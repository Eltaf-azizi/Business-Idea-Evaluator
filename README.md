<h1 align="center">Business Idea Evaluator</h1>

A smart AI-powered web application that helps startup founders and entrepreneurs evaluate their business ideas by generating structured SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) using OpenAI's GPT models. This project serves both as a learning tool to structure inputs and outputs with AI and as an MVP for AI-driven business insights.


## Project Overview

This web app allows users to input a startup idea and receive an organized SWOT analysis generated by an AI model. It provides actionable insights into the potential strengths, weaknesses, market opportunities, and threats related to the idea.

The project consists of:

 - A React-based frontend for user-friendly input and results display
 - A FastAPI backend that handles AI prompt generation and API communication
 - Integration with the OpenAI GPT API for natural language analysis

## Features

 - Simple and intuitive web UI to input startup ideas
 - Backend AI integration generating a detailed SWOT analysis
 - Real-time feedback, loading states, and error handling
 - Structured display of SWOT components in distinct sections
 - Clean, modular, and extensible codebase


## Tech Stack

 - Frontend: React.js, Fetch API, CSS3
 - Backend: FastAPI, Python 3.11, OpenAI GPT API
 - Deployment: Uvicorn, Docker (optional)
 - Environment Management: Python-dotenv


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

 - Node.js and npm (for frontend)
 - Python 3.11+ and pip (for backend)
 - OpenAI API key

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/business-idea-evaluator.git
cd business-idea-evaluator
```
2. Backend setup:
```
bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create .env file in backend/ directory:
```
text
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
MODEL_NAME=gpt-4
```
4. Run backend server:
```
bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```
5. Frontend setup (in separate terminal):
```
bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
6. Open frontend at http://localhost:3000


## How It Works

 - User enters a startup idea into the frontend input form
 - Frontend sends this text via API POST request to FastAPI backend
 - Backend builds a carefully crafted prompt and calls OpenAI GPT chat completion API
 - AI returns a detailed SWOT analysis response in structured text format
 - Backend parses AI output into a structured JSON object
 - Frontend receives JSON and renders each SWOT segment with lists and styling


## Usage

 - Enter any startup or business idea in natural language.
 - Click "Evaluate Idea" to generate SWOT analysis.
 - Review strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats highlighted AI-generated insights.
 - (Advanced Mode) Use expanded input forms for deep analysis and export generated reports.
